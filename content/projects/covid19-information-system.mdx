# COVID-19 Information & Appointment System

A comprehensive web platform developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide accessible information and streamline the testing appointment process. Built with Django, this system combines a public-facing informational website with a robust CRM for healthcare management.

## 🎯 Project Context

**Challenge**: During the pandemic, people needed easy access to COVID-19 information and testing appointments, while healthcare facilities struggled to manage high volumes of bookings.

**Solution**: An integrated platform providing:
- Up-to-date COVID-19 information
- Testing center locator with real-time availability
- Online appointment booking
- CRM system for healthcare workers
- Patient management and communication tools

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Public-Facing Website

**Information Portal**
- Latest COVID-19 guidelines and safety protocols
- Symptoms checker
- Vaccination information
- FAQ section with search functionality
- Multi-language support (English, Hebrew, French)

**Testing Center Locator**
```python
# views.py - Find nearest testing centers
def find_centers(request):
    user_location = request.GET.get('location')
    radius = request.GET.get('radius', 10)  # km

    centers = TestingCenter.objects.filter(
        is_active=True,
        available_slots__gt=0
    ).annotate(
        distance=Distance('location', user_location)
    ).filter(
        distance__lte=radius
    ).order_by('distance')

    return render(request, 'centers/list.html', {
        'centers': centers
    })
```

**Appointment Booking**
- Calendar interface with available time slots
- Patient information form with validation
- SMS/Email confirmation system
- Reminder notifications 24 hours before appointment
- Easy rescheduling and cancellation

### CRM & Admin System

**Healthcare Worker Dashboard**
- Daily appointment schedule
- Patient check-in system
- Test result recording
- Patient history and notes
- Statistical reports (daily tests, positive rates, etc.)

```python
# models.py - Core data models
class Appointment(models.Model):
    patient = models.ForeignKey(Patient, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    testing_center = models.ForeignKey(TestingCenter, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    appointment_date = models.DateTimeField()
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
    test_result = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['appointment_date']

class Patient(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()
    medical_conditions = models.TextField(blank=True)
    vaccination_status = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Smart Scheduling System
- Automatic slot management based on testing capacity
- Queue optimization to minimize wait times
- Conflict prevention (double-booking)
- Priority scheduling for high-risk individuals

### 2. Communication System
```python
# utils/notifications.py
from twilio.rest import Client
from django.core.mail import send_mail

def send_appointment_confirmation(appointment):
    # SMS notification
    client = Client(settings.TWILIO_SID, settings.TWILIO_TOKEN)
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=f"Your COVID-19 test is scheduled for {appointment.appointment_date}",
        from_=settings.TWILIO_NUMBER,
        to=appointment.patient.phone_number
    )

    # Email confirmation
    send_mail(
        subject='COVID-19 Test Appointment Confirmation',
        message=render_to_string('emails/confirmation.html', {
            'appointment': appointment
        }),
        from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
        recipient_list=[appointment.patient.user.email]
    )
```

### 3. Data Security & Privacy
- GDPR/HIPAA compliant data handling
- Encrypted patient information
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all data access
- Secure test result delivery

### 4. Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time testing statistics
- Trends visualization (Chart.js)
- Positive rate tracking by area
- Resource allocation insights
- Export functionality for health authorities

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Django Backend
```python
# settings.py - Key configurations
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'appointments',
    'patients',
    'testing_centers',
    'analytics',
    'crispy_forms',
    'django_filters',
]

# Custom user authentication
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'patients.CustomUser'

# Database - PostgreSQL for production
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'covid19_db',
    }
}
```

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Responsive design with Bootstrap
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic form validation, AJAX requests
- **Chart.js**: Interactive data visualization
- **Leaflet**: Map integration for testing center locator

### Database Design
- **Patients**: User info, medical history, appointments
- **Testing Centers**: Locations, capacity, schedule
- **Appointments**: Booking details, test results
- **Notifications**: SMS/Email queuing system
- **Analytics**: Aggregated statistics

## 📊 Impact & Results

- **1,500+ appointments** booked in first 3 months
- **40% reduction** in phone call volume to testing centers
- **95% show-up rate** thanks to reminder system
- **Positive feedback** from both patients and healthcare workers
