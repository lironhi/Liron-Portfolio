# AI Security Log Analyzer Agent

An advanced AI-powered system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures to automatically analyze security logs, detect anomalies, and flag suspicious activities. This project demonstrates the practical application of cutting-edge AI agent technologies in cybersecurity.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Security log analysis is traditionally a time-consuming manual process requiring expert knowledge. This project automates that process using LangGraph for orchestrating multiple AI agents that work together to:

- **Extract** relevant security events from diverse log formats
- **Classify** events by threat level and type
- **Detect** anomalies using pattern recognition and semantic analysis
- **Flag** suspicious activities for human review
- **Report** findings in actionable formats

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

The system uses a **multi-agent architecture** built with LangGraph, where specialized agents collaborate:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, List

class SecurityState(TypedDict):
    logs: List[str]
    parsed_events: List[dict]
    anomalies: List[dict]
    threats: List[dict]
    report: str

# Define the multi-agent workflow
workflow = StateGraph(SecurityState)

# Add specialized agents
workflow.add_node("parser", parse_logs_agent)
workflow.add_node("classifier", classify_events_agent)
workflow.add_node("detector", detect_anomalies_agent)
workflow.add_node("reporter", generate_report_agent)

# Define the flow
workflow.set_entry_point("parser")
workflow.add_edge("parser", "classifier")
workflow.add_edge("classifier", "detector")
workflow.add_edge("detector", "reporter")
workflow.add_edge("reporter", END)

# Compile the graph
security_analyzer = workflow.compile()
```

### Agent Responsibilities

1. **Parser Agent**
   - Processes raw log files (syslog, Apache, firewall logs, etc.)
   - Extracts structured data from unstructured text
   - Normalizes timestamps and formats

2. **Classifier Agent**
   - Categorizes events by type (login, file access, network, etc.)
   - Assigns initial threat levels (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Tags events with relevant security categories

3. **Detector Agent**
   - Analyzes patterns across multiple events
   - Uses semantic similarity (FAISS) to find related incidents
   - Identifies anomalies based on historical baselines
   - Detects known attack patterns (SQL injection, brute force, etc.)

4. **Reporter Agent**
   - Aggregates findings from all agents
   - Generates executive summaries
   - Creates detailed technical reports
   - Prioritizes threats for immediate action

## 🔧 Key Technologies

### LangGraph
Used for orchestrating the multi-agent workflow, managing state between agents, and handling conditional logic for different analysis paths.

```python
# Example of conditional routing based on threat level
def should_escalate(state):
    return any(threat['level'] == 'critical' for threat in state['threats'])

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "detector",
    should_escalate,
    {
        True: "immediate_alert",
        False: "reporter"
    }
)
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Implemented for efficient context management across multiple LLM calls, ensuring consistent analysis while minimizing token usage.

```python
from mcp import MCPClient, Context

# Initialize MCP client
mcp_client = MCPClient(
    model="gpt-4",
    max_context_length=8000
)

# Maintain context across agent interactions
context = Context()
context.add_system_message("You are a cybersecurity expert analyzing security logs...")
context.add_examples(few_shot_examples)

# Use context in agent calls
response = mcp_client.generate(
    prompt=f"Analyze this event: {event}",
    context=context
)
```

### FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
Used for vector-based similarity search to identify related security events and detect patterns.

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Create vector index for log embeddings
dimension = 1536  # OpenAI embedding dimension
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Add log embeddings to index
log_embeddings = generate_embeddings(logs)
index.add(np.array(log_embeddings))

# Search for similar events
def find_similar_events(query_event, k=5):
    query_embedding = generate_embedding(query_event)
    distances, indices = index.search(np.array([query_embedding]), k)
    return [(logs[i], distances[0][j]) for j, i in enumerate(indices[0])]
```

### Redis
Used for caching processed logs, embeddings, and analysis results to improve performance on repeated queries.

```python
import redis
import json

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Cache processed logs
def cache_analysis(log_id, analysis_result):
    r.setex(
        f"analysis:{log_id}",
        3600,  # 1 hour TTL
        json.dumps(analysis_result)
    )

# Retrieve cached analysis
def get_cached_analysis(log_id):
    cached = r.get(f"analysis:{log_id}")
    return json.loads(cached) if cached else None
```

## 🚀 Key Features

Automatically categorizes threats:
- **Authentication attacks**: Brute force, credential stuffing
- **Network attacks**: Port scanning, DDoS patterns
- **Data exfiltration**: Unusual data transfers
- **Privilege escalation**: Unauthorized access attempts
